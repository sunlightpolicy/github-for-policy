## Collaborative Policymaking

### Examples

*   [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io/) (White House Open Data Policy)
*   [New York State Open Data Handbook](http://nys-its.github.io/open-data-handbook/)
*   [Australian Capital Territory Open Data Policy](http://actgov.github.io/opendatapolicy/)

### Logistics

*   Content stored as [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) a near-plain text markup language for non-developers
*   Document(s) can be published using a custom HTML/CSS/Javscript template using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), or displayed simply as rendered (unstyled) HTML
*   Encourage editing via the web interface or via [prose.io](http://prose.io)

### Encouraging Contributions

*   Expose process: publish pre-release revision history, have discussions in public, memorialize meatspace discussions, leverage Issues, strive to maintain one class of contributors
*   Explicitly encourage contribution: in your project documentation and along side the published content.
*   License the content as appropriate, usually either Public Domain (CC0), or CC-BY
*   Communicate the big picture: roadmap, timelines, goals, vision, current status
*   Whenever possible, open source the problem, not the solution
*   Provide encouragement, feedback, and gratitude with each contribution
*   Minimize friction through tooling
*   Describe requirements and how to preview changes locally
*   Automated testing via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
*   Decentralize decision making authority to technical- and subject-matter experts as appropriate
*   See also [community building best practices](http://government.github.io/best-practices/collaborative-policymaking/community-building.md)

### Releases

*   Whenever possible, agency should regularly accept/reject proposed changes and cultivate community feedback
*   If necessary, if a document cannot be changed, community feedback can be curated on a seperate branch from `master`
*   `community` branch can be “released” (merged) on a regular release cycle in line with agency goals
